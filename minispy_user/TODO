@TODO
Revisit logging system. Replace all printfs with LOG_* variants?(kinda crazy, but mustbe done)
Implement task name and description support. This requires some changes and additions to simple package format.
Implement GetDiskType
Add logs to clr wrapper
Implement volume-disk-file restore target!
Extent nar_record structure to 16byte(so we can share lot's of stuff between USN-Extent codebase and this!)
Redesign full only backup.
linux compilation(with cmake probably)
find a way to shrink file system to lower than 50mb per million file. While existing compression algorithms (lz4, zstd) help doing that, it's not enough.
compression supported random access + compatible with restore.


@net : 
	- rewrite api endpoints in .net. 




@DONE
Remove data_array.
delete bunch of stuff from .net code.
region elimination algorithm for restore.
make restore like in USN-Backup system, generate read-write instructions.
