TODO

Redesign full only backup.
delete bunch of stuff from .net code.
linux compilation(with cmake probably)
find a way to shrink file system to lower than 50mb per million file. While existing compression algorithms (lz4, zstd) help doing that, it's not enough.
region elimination algorithm for restore.
compression supported random access + compatible with restore.
make restore like in USN-Backup system, generate read-write instructions.


@net : 
	- rewrite api endpoints in .net.
