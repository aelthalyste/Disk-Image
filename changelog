Changelog 30.11.2020 
-Before this update, SetIncRecords and SetDiffRecords was sorting and merging regions in mutex locked region, that was causing msg thread to stall and unable to 
fetch updates on time, causing it to skip significant amount of regions. That was pretty dumb, no idea how I did end up writing code like that, now in locked region, I
just fetch data, release mutex, then process it.
-This one is sneaky bug, in setupstreams, there is a special, but temporary, code block that adds mft regions to stream of records collected. Now that might not seem like a problem,
but if you end up adding lots of files since last backup, you will end up having completely different number of MFT records(generally speaking, it increases), but argument passed
on SetupStream, StreamInfo struct doesnt update accordingly! So you end up copying less bytes than needed, since extra addition of regions didnt updated in the StreamInfo struct. Causing
SetupStream to return false
-Looks like I was leaking almost all memory I allocted in the msg loop... Fixed
-SaveMetadata was interpreting non-changed volumes as errors but looks like volume might not change between versions. Now it accepts it
